Confused:retro:Why are we singing under this shady-ass bridge?
Eyeroll:dad:Because you complain about the heat. A LOT.
Happy:retro:You're right. You have no idea how hot it gets down there in Hell!
Annoyed:dad:Yes I do. I've visited you there a few times. You complain about it everytime. 
Smug:retro:Hey man. That's edgier tall me, I'm just tryna vibe.
Happy:dad:Oh, you want good vibes? Check out this song I made!
